### Within Margin Of Error

Next, we will factor in margin of error, and consider which states *may* have lost a seat because of an undercount, and which states *may* have gained a seat because of an overcount.

To do this, we generated a margin of error using the official RMSE (root mean square error) quoted in the undercount report, and used this as a means of figuring which states may have *potentially* fit this criteria. We used a margin of error of a single standard error (utilizing the census' official stated RMSE values), which is akin to a +/-34% margin of error.

```{r}
ucr = seatlosses
ucr$`Lose 1 Seat` = round((100*ucr$`Lose 1 Seat`/populations),1)
ucr$`Gain 1 Seat` = round((100*ucr$`Gain 1 Seat`/populations),1)

ME = pnorm(1) - .5

undercount = read.csv('undercount.csv',sep='',header=F)
undercount = undercount[,7:8]
colnames(undercount) = c('uc','RMSE')
undercount = undercount %>% mutate(
    lower_uc = round(uc - qnorm(.5 + ME)*RMSE,2),
    upper_uc = round(uc + qnorm(.5 + ME)*RMSE,2)
)

ucr = cbind(ucr,undercount)

ucr$miss_gain_se = ucr$upper_uc > ucr$`Gain 1 Seat`
ucr$avoided_se = ucr$lower_uc < ucr$`Lose 1 Seat`

ucr_filtered_se = ucr
ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat` = ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat` * ucr_filtered_se$avoided_se
ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat` = ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat` * ucr_filtered_se$miss_gain_se
ucr_filtered_se = ucr_filtered_se[ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat` <0 | ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat` > 0,]
ucr_filtered_se = ucr_filtered_se[!is.na(ucr_filtered_se$uc),]
ucr_filtered_se = ucr_filtered_se[,c(1:6)]
ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat` = ifelse(ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat` == 0, '--',ucr_filtered_se$`Lose 1 Seat`)
ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat` = ifelse(ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat` == 0, '--',ucr_filtered_se$`Gain 1 Seat`)

ucr_filtered_se
```

Minnesota and North Carolina have already been addressed, but three more states make an appearance here. 

Judging by these results, **California** may have avoided losing a congressional seat because of a lack of an undercount. It was undercounted by .26%, but our margin of error suggests it's reasonable to assume that it may have been overcounted by as much as .47% - and it came just .3% of population away from having one fewer congressional seat. So it's quite possible that mitigating an undercount saved California from losing a congressional seat.

**Washington state** is in the same boat as California. We estimate that Washington came .4% of population loss away from losing a congressional seat, but it's reasonable to assume that it may have been overcounted by as much as 1.24% - so perhaps mitigating an undercount saved Washington the loss of a seat as well.

Finally, it seems that **Missouri** potentially missed out on an additional seat because of an undercount. It was apparently overcounted by .66%, but we find it reasonable to assume that it may have been undercounted by .53% - which would have been enough to cost it the .5% population jump it needed to secure another seat.

We are quite happy to develop more precise numbers for your state, and help to calculate the percentage chance that it gained or lost out on a congressional seat because of census response rates (contact details below).

Next, we will factor in margin of error, and consider which states *may* have lost a seat because of an undercount, and which states *may* have gained a seat because of an overcount.

We used a +/-34% margin of error (see the data journalist's version of this article - linked to at the top of this one - for more detailed information and the reasoning behind this decision)
